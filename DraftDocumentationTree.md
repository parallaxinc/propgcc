### PropGCC DRAFT Documentation ###
5/7/12 - An attempt to pull together all the various bits and pieces of PropGCC documentation scattered all over the place. As with most things, built upon the work of those that have gone before me.

11/10/13 - Some updates and clarifications to the "draft". Most likely this will be removed unless someone indicates a desire to build on it soon.

It's ugly right now. This is just an outlining tool at this point to gather thoughts and structure. Feel free to comment.

### SimpleIDE ###
[(download)](http://code.google.com/p/propside/downloads/list)

SimpleIDE is:

  * A multiple O/S and internationalized Integrated Development Environment designed specifically for Propeller GCC
  * For writing programs, managing project compile/link, and programming Propeller in one application
  * For integrating Propeller PASM, COG C source, and/or Propeller SMP threading into projects
  * For programmers that do not want to use the more flexible but steeper learning curve "make" system
  * For programmers who will not miss features like integrated source control or debugging
  * For users who do not want to install Java or .Net on their Linux, MAC, or Windows computer

SimpleIDE is not designed to meet expectations of large enterprise class professional programmer or management. A professional C/C++ programmer can use PropellerGCC with Eclipse, Netbeans, or other IDEs.

### Propeller GCC Command Line Package ###
This project is a GCC port for the [Parallax Propeller P8x32a Microcontroller](http://www.parallax.com/PropellerChips/tabid/833/Default.aspx).
